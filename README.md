## Docker
### Install
- I installed the Docker Desktop, easy to use.
### Dockerize your application

- Dockerize PhoneBook_backend to run it in an isolated environment, a.k.a. container.
- A container is a standardized unit of software that assembles code, runtime, dependencies, settings, and initialization in a single package that you can run reliably from one computing environment to another. 

### Step 
Run cmd, cd to the path of the application. eg. D:\git_repo\phone-book-backend
1. $ mvn package
2. $ docker build -t pb-docker .
3. $ docker run -p 5000:8080 -t pb-docker\
\
*Note: specified that the port 8080 on the container should be mapped to the port 5000 on the Host OS.*

#### Push to DockerHub
1. $ docker login
2. $ docker tag pb-docker huxingran/phone_book_backend:modified 
3. $ docker push huxingran/phone_book_backend:modified
